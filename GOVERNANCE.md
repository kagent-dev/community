# Kagent governance

Kagent is dedicated to bring agentic AI to the cloud native ecosystem. This governance document details how the project is run.

## Values

The kagent project embraces the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.
* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.
* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals.  Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.
* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.
* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.

## Roles and membership

Our governance builds on top of definitions from other documents, review the following files for relevant information:

* [CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md](./CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md) for the different roles with the project.
* [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md) for the project maintainers, including their organizational affiliation.
* [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) for our code of conduct.

## Voting

While most business in kagent is conducted by "[lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html)",
periodically the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes. The following rules govern our voting process, unless otherwise stated for a specific purpose.

* A vote begins when someone adds a GitHub issue comment or PR comment containing the `/vote` command.
* A vote is cast when a user emotes thumbs-up (üëç) or thumbs-down (üëé) on the specific "vote" created by the git-vote bot on the GitHub issue/PR.
* A simple majority of eligible votes decides the vote outcome.
* No single company should have more than six eligible voters. It is the responsibility of each company to determine which affiliated maintainers are the eligible voters.
* Voting must be open for at least one week or until the required threshold is met, whichever is sooner.
* Only votes by eligible voters will count towards the final tally, but everyone is welcome to cast a non-binding vote to show their support.
* If the vote is done within a PR, then the vote refers to the most recent commit at the time the vote is created. If there is any further commit to the PR, a new vote must be created.

## Changes to governance

All changes to our governance model require a vote by the maintainers. The proposed change will be submitted as a PR against the kagent community repository. Voting will proceed according to the rules established for simple conflict resolution, with the sole exception being the threshold for acceptance.

* Any change requires a 2/3 super majority to be accepted.
