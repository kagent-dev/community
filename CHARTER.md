# Kagent Charter

## Mission 

The kagent project strives to solve operation challenges related to cloud native using AI, and bringing agentic AI to cloud native.

## Scope

Kagent is open-source framework for DevOps and platform engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and troubleshooting tasks. Kagent is built for cloud-native operations, leveraging MCP tools, agents and frameworks.

## Values

### Inclusive

Kagent was initially created by a capable group of engineers with deep experience solving cloud native operation challenges. We strive to build an inclusive community where all good-faith input is appreciated and diverse opinions and contributions are welcomed.

### Merit

We weigh contributions based on their merits, not based on their source. We recognize that finding time for open source contributions can be challenging and appreciate the time and effort our contributors put into their work.

### Open

Kagent is open source. We believe through combined efforts, shared experience and the strength of open community we can build a better cloud native operation story using natural languages.
